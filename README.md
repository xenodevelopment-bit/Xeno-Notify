I've redesigned the ESX notification system to give it a more modern and premium feel while maintaining performance. This redesign focuses on smooth animations, better visual hierarchy, and improved readability.

Created by Xeno Development for Fivem Servers!

## Features

- 🎨 Modern gradient design

- ✨ Smooth animations for notifications and icons

- 🎯 Distinct styles for success, error, and info notifications

- 📱 Centered notifications with progress indicator

- 🔄 Continuous icon animations

- ⚡ No blur effects for better performance


## Installation

1. Replace the contents of `[core]/esx_notify` with the new contents

2. Run the script in server.cfg

3. If not WORKING rename script to esx_notify or open ticket in discord support https://discord.gg/j654YhJytF

## Test Commands

- `/nsuccess` - Shows a success notification

- `/nerror` - Shows an error notification

- `/ninfo` - Shows an info notification

- `/nlong` - Shows a long text notification

- `/ncolor` - Shows a notification with all color options
